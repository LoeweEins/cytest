# Introduction
This is a automation test framework written by Zeen for the first time, where I merged the mature and mainly used framework 'pytest' and an experimental framework 'hytest'. The two automation framework almost built my entire carrier as a software testing engineer. 

`cytest` is named from the spelling of my name `ze` in `Wade-Giles Romanization System`, that is `chak`. I appreciate this character so much that I named it as a part of my first project which means a lot to me.

`cytest` might not be comparable to other test frameworks on Github, but I'm working hard on it and constantly update my little `cytest`.

I'm also applying `fixture` mechanism to `cytest` to make sure it is so popular and evolves with the latest trend.

## Installation

```py
pip3 install cytest
```
